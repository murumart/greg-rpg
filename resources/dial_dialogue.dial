	what are you up to?
CHOICE_LINK you
	about me? i'm a naturalist.
	i study the flora and the fauna. it's very interesting.
	the flora and fauna, i mean.
LOOP 2
	and the studying!
CHOICE_LINK me
	about you? you're new in town, i think.
	i don't pay too much attention to such matters.
	people coming and going, i mean.
LOOP 2
	even though it barely ever happens.
CHOICE_LINK stray
	about the stray pets?
	they've been pretty devastating for the local ecosystem.
	well, so have the people.
	interestingly, the pets' population seems to have declined sharply.
CHOICES ok,pets
	i suppose there's some good in that.
	
CHOICE_LINK pets
	about the lizards in general...
	this sounds like a first-grade topic of discussion.
	they're domesticated.
	some people think they're cute, and keep them as company.
	farmers use them to herd animals, hunters too.
	the lizards tend to return to a wild state when neglected, though...
LOOP 2
	so any "professional" animals have to be very well trained.
	
CHOICE_LINK turf
	it's an interesting symbiotic adaptation.
	the turf, i mean. it's not a single organism.
	the blades of grass itself benefit from the frequent change of soil...
	...and the leeches that transport it around benefit from the cover...
	...and we think, even from the grass' photosynthesis.
CHOICES ok,flora
	they also eat worms in the soil together.
	
CHOICE_LINK flora
	about the flora? i love these questions!
	it's strangely bland in this region, to be quite honest.
	there's a few tree species, and the turf i talked about is very abundant.
	in the woods, not much new...
	the very same trees, the very same grass.
CHOICES ok,trees,flowers,shrubs,bushes,algae
	and the flowers that make you sleepy, you know.

CHOICE_LINK trees
	about the trees? i'm very adjusted to the sight of them.
	some are coniferous, but most here are broadleaf trees.
	the lakeside has trees adapted to the wetter soil.
LOOP 2
	but, strangely, that's it.
CHOICE_LINK flowers
	about the flowers? there's a few...
	uh, there's... there's the little white ones in the grass...
	...and in the woods, the flowers that make you sleepy.
	...yeah, it's really bland. i feel compelled to apologise.
LOOP 2
	even though, you know, i'm not responsible for the lack of diversity.
CHOICE_LINK shrubs
	about shrubs? completely underrepresented.
	in the woods, there's only trees and a very consistent grass cover.
LOOP 2
	no shrubs to speak of. i can't say what has caused this.
CHOICE_LINK bushes
	about bushes? i haven't seen any around here.
	not in the woods, either, nothing.
	really nothing between the groundcover and canopy... now that i think...
LOOP 2
	i don't particularily enjoy it, but it's something unique here.
CHOICE_LINK algae
	we don't talk about the algae.
LOOP 2
	it's rude to talk behind someone's back while they're listening.

CHOICE_LINK birds
	i love birds!
	they eat all kinds of bugs that could annoy a gardener.
	and cigarette butts.
	there's some bigger birds around town as well.
	it's interesting to see that some have adapted to fly with four wings...
	...leaving the feet for walking, but some fly with only two wings.
	the phylogeny in that regard is also very interesting.
CHOICES ok,name
	i love birds!
	
CHOICE_LINK name
	name all birds? sure!
	%s, %s, %s...

	%s, %s, %s...
	the great tit, %s, %s...
LOOP 2
	i'm getting tired... i hope that was enough of a selection.

CHOICE_LINK snails
	about the snails?
	a gardener's nightmare, but visible on streets, too, once it gets dry.
	their defense mechanism is wonderfully unique...
	but some people misuse it...
	i mean, i guess it's fine if you're doing it for, like, inspiration...
	some of the artists on the mainland have... uh... credited...
	...their works to snail-induced dreams, but, uh...
	i don't... i just don't think it's... well... 
LOOP 2
	uhm...
CHOICE_LINK fish
	about the fish? the ones in this region can be rather aggressive.
	the tendency to jump out of the water and beat peoples' asses...
	...is a local adaptation. to what, we're not sure.
	the fishermen here have to be hardened souls.
	of course, humans don't actually have souls.
CHOICES ok,humans
	that was just a saying, i mean.

CHOICE_LINK humans
	about humans?
	...are you sure you didn't miss first grade?
	...
	...i mean, i can humor you... don't have to be snarky at me like that...
	we're pretty sure humans were transported here magically.
	there's a few theories on how that could have happened.
	and a few fanatical sects. more of the latter, really.
	i mean, less people care about... uh... the science of it...
	...grumble...
	in short, we're an invasive species. and the spirits are very secretive about it.
	should be obvious... we don't have six limbs like other vertebrates.
CHOICES ok,spirits
	unless you think we were descended from insects...

CHOICE_LINK spirits
	about spirits...
	that's not exactly my area of expertise, though sometimes...
	...it is needed to consider the spirits' effect on the flora and fauna.
	animals and plants live in symbiosis with spirits quite often.
	up to a point, of course... spirits usually turn out to be parasites.
CHOICES ok,origin
	never trust a spirit, ha ha. that's my, uh, advice.

CHOICE_LINK origin
	the origin of spirits... i don't know, man...
	it'd be so much easier if they didn't exist.
	but nooo... we have to account for "intelligent design" and such issues.
	i mean, some spirits can affect the world as they wish.
	it could be why the flora is this bland in this region.
	i'd say the spirit who designed this was just lazy, though.
	origin... it could be the same place where humans originate.
	or maybe they were the ones to transport us here.
	that's the easiest explanation to any issue, really...
LOOP 2
	but not really, because the question then transforms to "why" that happened.

CHOICE_LINK campsite
	about this campsite?
	i think this place used to be livelier.
	the town used to come together here in summers, i believe.
	but now it's just a place for thugs to congregate.
	or, i mean, was. there's no more thugs.
	i'm sure someone could get the campfire going again...
LOOP 2
	...just by using something to light it.

CHOICE_LINK ok

	where was i...
CHOICE_LINK bye

CHOICE_LINK yes
	i will grind you to dust!
CHOICE_LINK help
	how to play?
	use the right and left movement keys to move your "paddle".
	you control the bottom paddle.
	you must catch the "ball" with your paddle and bounce it back to me.
	if you don't, you'll lose a "life".
	furthermore, to gain points, you must win in a game of...
	..."rock paper scissors". you navigate between choices with move keys.
CHOICES no!!,yes!!
	do you need help with "rock paper scissors"?
CHOICE_LINK no!!
	great. whoever gains 3000 points wins.
	whoever loses 3 lives, loses!
LOOP 1
	that's it.
CHOICE_LINK yes!!
	in essence, "rock paper scissors" is a game of luck.
	it is played between two players. both players make a choice.
	they spontaneously choose between "rock", "paper", and "scissors".
	they both display their choice using a hand sign:
	"rock" is a closed fist,
	"paper" is a flat hand,
	"scissors" is signed with your index and middle finger standing...
	...upright, but your other fingers curled.
	can you do that? i hope you understood.
	then, a victor is decided between the two players.
	the hand signs go in pairs - one wins over the other.
	the scissors cut paper, thus the player with scissors...
	...wins, if the other player picked paper.
	the rock breaks scissors! rock wins over scissors.
	and paper, well... this never made too much sense to me.
	but the paper covers the rock, thus winning.
	as you might have noticed, the relations are in a "loop".
	scissors triumph over paper, which trumps rock, which trumps scissors.
	in the game, when the ball bounces on your paddle...
	...you can gain points when you win the game of rock paper scissors.
	and whatever you chose as your hand...
	...that choice is played at the enemy's paddle, too.
LOOP 0
	i hope i cleared some things up.
