# Greg RPG

Greetings. Welcome to the Greg RPG Git repository. Please play the game before perusing the files. Don't spoil anything for others or yourself.


## What is "Greg RPG"?

I started developing this game with a clear idea in my head. A crudely drawn, short, simplistic RPG that would let me dip my toes in releasing games before I start making things I actually care about.

Then I started caring about Greg. So it took over 2 years to finish the game. But maybe that's good... I am proud of parts of the final product.

It will be released on Itch and Game Jolt in the summer of 2024. Soon!
